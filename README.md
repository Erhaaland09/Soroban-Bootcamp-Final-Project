## HEALATA : Decentralised Health Data Management

## Overview

HEALATA is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Stellar/Soroban platform designed to empower users to manage and share their health data securely. This application allows patients to upload their personal health data, including their file number, name of patient,what disease they had?,what is their gender?,their blood group, and which doctor they visited etc...    

By sharing their data for research purposes, users are rewarded with tokens, promoting active participation in medical research while ensuring data privacy and consent through smart contracts.

## Features

- **Provide Data for Research**: Users can safely provide their health information for research purpose.
- **Token Rewards**: In return, they earn tokens for contributing their personal data to medical research.
- **Smart Contract Management**: Data privacy and user consent are managed transparently through the use of Soroban smart contracts.
- **Research Support**: Facilitates medical research by providing access to anonymized datasets.

## How It Works

**Data Submission**: Users submit their health data through a secure interface.
**Consent Management**: Before data is used, researchers must obtain consent via smart contracts.
**Token Distribution**: Tokens are automatically distributed to users as rewards for data sharing.

## Technologies

- **Stellar/Soroban**: Utilizes Stellar blockchain and Soroban smart contracts for secure and efficient transactions.
- **Token Protocol**: Implements a custom token protocol for rewards distribution.
- **Frontend Frameworks** :  React App along with material UI is used to build an amazing user friendly interactive frontend.
